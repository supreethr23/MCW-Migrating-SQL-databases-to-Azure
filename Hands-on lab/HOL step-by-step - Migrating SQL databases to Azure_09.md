## Exercise 1: Improve database security posture with Data Discovery and Classification and Azure Defender for SQL

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you are able to set up some of the advanced security features of SQL MI and explore some of the security benefits that come with running your database in Azure. [Azure Defender for SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/azure-defender-for-sql) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database. Also, [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview) allows you to discover and classify sensitive data within the database.

### Task 1: Configure Data Discovery and Classification

In this task, you review the [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview) feature of Azure SQL. Data Discovery & Classification introduces a new tool for discovering, classifying, labelling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in your database, not just the database. Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (e.g., business, financial, healthcare) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.

1. Navigate to **SQLMI-Shared-RG** resource group and select the SQL Managed instance named **sqlmi--cus**. Now, from the **Overview** tab select the Managed database named which you note down in Lab 1 Data Modernization: Migrate SQL DB to Azure SQL MI name start like **WideWorldImporters{suffix}**.

1. On the **WideWorldImporters{suffix}** Managed database blade, select **Data Discovery & Classification** from the left-hand menu.

   ![The Data Discovery & Classification tile is displayed.](media/ex9-task1-step2.png "Data Discovery & Classification Dashboard")

1. In the **Data Discovery & Classification** blade, select the info link with the message **Currently database is using SQL Information Protection policy. Found 35 columns with classification recommendations**.

   ![The recommendations link on the Data Discovery & Classification blade is highlighted.](media/datamod12.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Look over the list of recommendations to get a better understanding of the types of data and classifications that can be assigned, based on the built-in classification settings. In the list of classification recommendations, select the recommendation for the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field.

   ![The CreditCard number recommendation is highlighted in the recommendations list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-credit-card.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Due to the risk of exposing credit card information, WWI would like a way to classify it as highly confidential, not just **Confidential**, as the recommendation suggests. To correct this, select **+ Add classification** at the top of the Data Discovery & Classification blade.

   ![The +Add classification button is highlighted in the toolbar.](media/ex9-task1-step5.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Quickly expand the **Sensitivity label** field and review the various built-in labels from which you can choose. You can also add custom labels, should you desire.

   ![The list of built-in Sensitivity labels is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-sensitivity-labels.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. In the Add classification dialog, enter the following:

   - **Schema name**: Select **Sales**.
   - **Table name**: Select **CreditCard**.
   - **Column name**: Select **CardNumber (nvarchar)**.
   - **Information type**: Select **Credit Card**.
   - **Sensitivity level**: Select **Highly Confidential**.

      ![The values specified above are entered into the Add classification dialog.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification.png "Add classification")

1. Select **Add classification**.

1. Notice that the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field disappears from the recommendations list, and the number of recommendations drops by 1.

1. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

   ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")

1. Other recommendations you can review are the **HumanResources - Employee** fields for **NationIDNumber** and **BirthDate**. Note that the recommendation service flagged these fields as **Confidential - GDPR**. WWI maintains data about gamers from around the world, including Europe, so having a tool that helps them discover data that may be relevant to GDPR compliance is very helpful.

    ![GDPR information is highlighted in the list of recommendations](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-gdpr.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Check the **Select all** checkbox at the top of the list to select all the remaining recommended classifications, and then select **Accept selected recommendations**.

    ![All the recommended classifications are checked, and the Accept selected recommendations button is highlighted.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-accept-recommendations.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

    ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")

1. When the save completes, select the **Overview** tab on the Data Discovery & Classification blade to view a report with a full summary of the database classification state.

    ![The View Report button is highlighted on the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-overview-report.png "View report")
